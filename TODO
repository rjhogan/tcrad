x - use adept::Array instead of "aArray"
x - proper interface to Config structure
x - code only works with one column at a time (?)
x - C++ routine that does the full radiance and flux problem then a conversion layer from Fortran
 - C/Fortran interface with pointers to contiguous arrays
 - Decide package name
 - Add TL/AD/K
x - Check RTTOV interface
x - Comments
 - ICA version
 - only compute layer boundary fluxes that are actually used, e.g. up at base and down at top
x - remove redundant variables
 - Stack held in config object, possibly renamed context
x - od_scaling should be dimensioned NREGIONS-1
x - ssa should be dimensioned NREGIONS-1
